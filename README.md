# Thoughts
Managing the state of components in an application is made easy by React. State change triggers event function that will be propagated automatically to children components. Redux reinforces this pattern by enforcing the principle of single source of truth. In the end, with React-Redux model, UI management evolves to fancy manipulation of a single client side data base.
